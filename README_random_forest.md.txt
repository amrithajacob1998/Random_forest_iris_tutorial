# Random Forest Classifier – Iris Dataset Tutorial

This project is a complete walkthrough of the Random Forest classification algorithm using the Iris dataset. It includes theory, code, visualizations, and evaluation of model performance, with a focus on interpretability, accessibility, and ensemble learning.

## Overview

The tutorial covers:
- The theory behind Random Forest and ensemble methods
- Bootstrapping and random feature selection
- Training, evaluating, and interpreting a Random Forest Classifier
- Using Out-of-Bag (OOB) validation
- Visualizing confusion matrices and feature importances
